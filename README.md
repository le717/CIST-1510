# CIST-1510
> PHP-based website for CIST-1510 class

## Background

I had to make a site for my final project. It had to have an index, navbar, table, and blog. That's what I did. I also used [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for the styling. I got :100: on the site.

## Usage

It probably won't work. It was the first time I used PHP and I didn't actually learn the language for another year.
Fixing it will be a death by a thousand papercuts. If you want to fix it, even though it's nothing special, go right ahead.
